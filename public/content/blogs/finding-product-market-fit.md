Product-Market Fit is the holy grail of startups. Here's how to find it:

## Signs You Haven't Found PMF:

- Users don't stick around
- Growth feels forced
- You're constantly pivoting
- Sales conversations are hard

## Signs You've Found PMF:

- Users tell their friends
- Growth feels organic
- You can't keep up with demand
- People are upset when your product goes down

## How to Get There:

### 1. Talk to 100 Potential Users

Understand their pain points deeply. Not just surface-level complaints.

### 2. Build the Minimum Lovable Product

Not just viable - lovable. Something people genuinely want to use.

### 3. Get 10 Power Users

Find users who would be devastated if your product disappeared.

### 4. Iterate Based on Data

Track everything. Let data guide your decisions.

### 5. Don't Scale Too Early

PMF first, scale second. Always.

**Remember: PMF is not a milestone - it's a continuous state you need to maintain.**
