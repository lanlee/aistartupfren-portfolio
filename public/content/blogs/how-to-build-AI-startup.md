Building an AI startup in 2026 requires a unique approach. Here are the key steps:

## 1. Find a Real Problem

Don't build AI for the sake of AI. Find a genuine pain point that people are willing to pay to solve.

## 2. Start Small, Think Big

Begin with a focused MVP. Don't try to build everything at once.

## 3. Focus on Distribution Early

The best product doesn't win - the best distributed product wins. Think about your go-to-market strategy from day one.

## 4. Build in Public

Share your journey, learnings, and progress. It creates accountability and attracts early users.

## 5. Iterate Based on Feedback

Talk to users constantly. Build what they need, not what you think is cool.

**Remember: execution beats ideas every single time.**
